# You are given a 
# mÃ—n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

# -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
# 0 - A treasure chest.
# INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.
# Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest than the value should remain INF.

# Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

# Modify the grid in-place.

# Example 1:

# Input: [
#   [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
#   [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
#   [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
#   [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
# ]

# Output: [
#   [3,-1,0,1],
#   [2,2,1,-1],
#   [1,-1,2,-1],
#   [0,-1,3,4]
# ]
# Example 2:

# Input: [
#   [0,-1],
#   [2147483647,2147483647]
# ]

# Output: [
#   [0,-1],
#   [1,2]
# ]

#multi source bfs solution
#start bfs from every treasure and mark the distance to each land
#time complexity (O(m * n)) where m is number of rows and n is number of cols
#space complexity (O(m * n)) where m is number of rows and n is number of cols

#I like initializing the possible values for land, water, and treasure as class variables
#that way they're not just magic numbers
#initialize rows and cols to the len of rows and cols
#initialize the visit set
#initialize the queue using deque since python. Remember to use popleft() here

#loop through the rows and cols of the grid
#check if the item is a treasure
#if so, add to the queue and the visit set

#initialize the distance variable to 0
#while the queue is not empty
#loop through the queue. This gets the full layer of the queue. So initially treasures are added. Then all lands 1 distance from treasures. 
#popleft from the queue
#set the value of grid[r][c] to the distance. Initially distance is 0, so all treasures are set to 0 which they are anyways

#call the addLand function on all 4 directions
#increment the distance variable outside the for loop

#addland function
#will check if the row and col are out of bounds, in the visit queue, or if the item is water
# if so, return
#otherwise, add the row and col to the visit set and append it to the queue

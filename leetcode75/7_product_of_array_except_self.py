# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
# Output: [0,0,9,0,0]



#solution using prefix/suffix array array
#make sure to set first val of prefix and last val of suffix to 1
# start at 1 from left and fill prefix
# start at 2 from right and fill suffix
# res just normal loop pref[i] * suff[i]

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        pref = [0] * n
        suff = [0] * n
        res = [0] * n
        pref[0] = suff[n - 1] = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            pref[i] = nums[i - 1] * pref[i - 1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            suff[i] = nums[i + 1] * suff[i + 1]
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] = pref[i] * suff[i]
        return res

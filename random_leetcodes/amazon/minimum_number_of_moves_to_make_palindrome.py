# You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters.

# In one move, you can select any two adjacent characters of s and swap them.

# Return the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome.

# Note that the input will be generated such that s can always be converted to a palindrome.

#greedy solution
# Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
# Space Complexity: O(n)


# The code converts the string to a list for easier character manipulation
# It processes the string from both ends (like forming a palindrome)
# For each iteration:

  # It looks for the first occurrence of the last character
  # If that character is the last one itself (unique character), it needs i/2 swaps to position it in the middle
  # Otherwise, it needs i swaps to bring the matching character to the front
  # It removes both matched characters and continues
